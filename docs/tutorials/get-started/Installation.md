                "server": {
                    "$path":"src/server"
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

## Recommended LSP

For the best experience, we recommend to use the [LuauLSP](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JohnnyMorganz.luau-lsp) extension for Visual Studio Code.

??? Typescript-Types
	You can also use typescript, just be sure you have installed [roblox-ts](https://roblox-ts.com/)

Once you have installed LuauLSP then go to extension settings and search ‚ÄúDefinition Files‚Äù

Click on "Add Item" and then enter this path `packages/UpsideEngine/upside-engine.d.luau`. Then click again on "Add Item" and then enter this path too `packages/UpsideEngine/src/init.d.luau`.


## An important step

To ensure that the Upside Engine works correctly, it is important to initialize the engine on the server, even if you are not using any server-side functionality. This is because some services, such as `NetworkingService`, depend on the server side.

Here is an example of how to initialize upside engine:

```lua
local replicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
local packages = replicatedStorage.packages

local upsideEngine = require(packages.UpsideEngine)
print("Upside Engine version: " .. upsideEngine.Version)
```
